# Homepage Video & Toast Hook Fixes - 2025-10-17

## Summary
Fixed two critical issues in the Recovery Compass application:
1. Desktop homepage video not displaying (mobile worked fine)
2. useToast hook listener accumulation causing memory leaks

## Issue #1: Desktop Video Display

### Problem
Desktop browsers weren't displaying the homepage hero video, despite:
- Correct video files in `/public/videos/`
- Both videos verified to contain lighthouse imagery
- Mobile video working perfectly

### Root Cause
Browser compatibility issue with `<source media="...">` elements. The component used:
```tsx
<video>
  <source media="(max-width: 768px)" src={MP4_MOBILE} />
  <source src={MP4_DESKTOP} />
</video>
```

Not all browsers reliably support media queries on `<source>` elements within `<video>` tags.

### Solution
Changed to direct `src` attribute with React state:
```tsx
const videoSrc = isMobile ? MP4_MOBILE : MP4_DESKTOP;

<video
  key={videoSrc}  // Force re-mount on change
  src={videoSrc}
  ...
/>
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Universal browser compatibility
- ✅ Explicit video selection via React state
- ✅ Forced re-mount on viewport changes
- ✅ Simpler, more maintainable code

### Files Modified
- `src/components/HeroBackground.tsx`

### Commit
- `9b711df` - "fix: Use direct src attribute instead of source media queries for video selection"

## Issue #2: useToast Listener Accumulation

### Problem
The `useToast` hook was registering listeners repeatedly, causing:
- Memory leaks
- Performance degradation
- Potential race conditions

### Root Cause
The `useEffect` had `[state]` in its dependency array:
```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  listeners.push(setState)
  return () => {
    const index = listeners.indexOf(setState)
    if (index > -1) {
      listeners.splice(index, 1)
    }
  }
}, [state])  // ❌ Re-runs on every state change
```

This caused the listener to be re-registered every time the toast state changed.

### Solution
Changed to empty dependency array:
```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  listeners.push(setState)
  return () => {
    const index = listeners.indexOf(setState)
    if (index > -1) {
      listeners.splice(index, 1)
    }
  }
}, [])  // ✅ Runs only once on mount
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Listener registered only once on mount
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Follows React best practices

### Files Modified
- `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`

### Commit
- `cb39ee0` - "fix: Prevent useToast listener accumulation with empty dependency array"

## Next Steps

1. **Test Desktop Video**: Open homepage on desktop browser, verify video displays with lighthouse
2. **Test Mobile Video**: Open homepage on mobile, verify video still works correctly
3. **Test Responsive**: Resize browser window, verify video switches correctly
4. **Monitor Toast Performance**: Watch for any toast-related memory issues (should be resolved)
5. **Deploy to Production**: Trigger Cloudflare Pages deployment from GitHub
