## SYSTEM GAPS ADDRESSED

### Gap 1: Information Asymmetry (1h39m delay) ✅
**Problem:** No real-time status visibility  
**Solution:** CURRENT_STATE.md with auto-timestamping (Week 2 GitHub Action)

### Gap 2: Strategic Confusion ✅
**Problem:** Historical vs. current approaches unclear  
**Solution:** STRATEGY_HISTORY.md with ACTIVE/DEPRECATED/HISTORICAL markers

### Gap 3: Permission-Seeking Behavior ✅
**Problem:** Artificial bottlenecks ("would you like me to proceed?")  
**Solution:** AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION_POLICY.md with clear criteria

### Gap 4: Verification Gaps ✅
**Problem:** Assumptions treated as facts (corrective deed detour)  
**Solution:** proof-first-check.sh interactive verification

### Gap 5: Context Degradation ✅
**Problem:** No persistent memory across sessions  
**Solution:** CONTEXT_LOG with 5-Bird element tagging
