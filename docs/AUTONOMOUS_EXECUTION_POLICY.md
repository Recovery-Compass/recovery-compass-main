## DECISION PROTOCOL

When uncertain, apply 5-Bird analysis:

1. **Intelligence:** Is this reversible? (If YES → Execute)
2. **Evidence:** Does this commit resources? (If NO → Execute)
3. **Coalition:** Does this affect external stakeholders? (If NO → Execute)
4. **Regulatory:** Is this documented in existing plan? (If YES → Execute)
5. **Counter-intel:** Could this create unintended consequences? (If NO → Execute)

**Default to execution.** Only pause for true blockers.
