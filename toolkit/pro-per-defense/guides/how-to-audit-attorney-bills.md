# How to Audit Attorney Bills - Step-by-Step Guide

**Time Required:** 3-5 hours  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Tools Needed:** Spreadsheet software, attorney invoices, highlighter  
**Expected Outcome:** Detailed violation analysis + justified fee calculation

---

## Overview

This guide teaches you how to systematically audit attorney invoices to identify common billing violations and calculate justified vs. unjustified fees. The methodology is based on California Rules of Professional Conduct and proven strategies from the Kirk Kolodji case study ($8,000-10,000 in violations identified).

---

## Step 1: Gather All Documents (30 minutes)

### Required Documents:
- ✅ All attorney invoices (complete billing period)
- ✅ Retainer agreement (fee structure, scope of work)
- ✅ Email communications with attorney
- ✅ Court filings (show work actually performed)
- ✅ Attorney termination documents (if applicable)

### Optional But Helpful:
- Attorney's State Bar profile (verify license, specializations)
- Industry billing standards for your jurisdiction
- Comparable attorney fee cases in your area

### Organization:
1. Create folder: "Attorney Fee Dispute - [Attorney Name]"
2. Subfolders: "Invoices," "Emails," "Court Filings," "Analysis"
3. Number documents chronologically
4. Create master timeline spreadsheet

---

## Step 2: Understand the Legal Standards (30 minutes)

### California Rule 1.5(a): Reasonable Fees

Attorney fees must be reasonable, considering:
1. Time and labor required
2. Novelty and difficulty of questions
3. Skill requisite to perform service
4. Preclusion of other employment
5. Customary fee in locality
6. Amount involved and results obtained
7. Time limitations
8. Nature and length of relationship
9. Experience, reputation, and ability
10. Whether fee is fixed or contingent

### Key Principle:
**Burden of proof is on attorney** to demonstrate fees are reasonable.

---

## Step 3: Create Billing Audit Spreadsheet (30 minutes)

### Column Structure:

| Column | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Date | Date of service | 10/17/2025 |
| Attorney/Staff | Who performed work | Kirk Kolodji |
| Description | Task description | "Draft motion, email client" |
| Hours | Time billed | 2.0 |
| Rate | Hourly rate | $350 |
| Amount | Total charge | $700 |
| Violation Type | Category | Block billing |
| Notes | Analysis | Combines 2 tasks |
| Justified Amount | After reduction | $490 |
| Excess | Unjustified portion | $210 |

### Template Available:
[Billing Audit Spreadsheet Template](../templates/billing-audit-spreadsheet-template.md)

---

## Step 4: Identify Block Billing Violations (60-90 minutes)

### What Is Block Billing?

Combining multiple distinct tasks into single time entry, making it impossible to verify reasonableness of time spent on each task.

### Red Flags:
- Multiple verbs in single entry ("draft, review, email, call")
- Use of semicolons or "and" separating tasks
- More than 2 distinct activities in one entry

### Examples from Kirk Kolodji Case:

**Violation Example:**
> "Update case files with pleadings from dissolution matter **and** rulings on restraining order, **and** email client; Draft Demand for Production of Documents, **and** Form Interrogatories" (2.0 hours, $250)

**Should Be Itemized As:**
- Update case files with dissolution pleadings (0.2 hours)
- Update case files with restraining order rulings (0.2 hours)
- Email client (0.1 hours)
- Draft Demand for Production (0.8 hours)
- Draft Form Interrogatories (0.7 hours)

### How to Audit for Block Billing:

1. Read each invoice entry
2. Count distinct tasks (verbs: draft, review, email, call, file)
3. If 3+ tasks in single entry, mark as block billing violation
4. Estimate time for each task using [Industry Standards Reference](industry-standards-reference.md)
5. If total matches but tasks not separated, still mark as violation
6. Apply 30% reduction for systematic block billing

### Legal Authority:
*Christian Research Institute v. Alnor*, 165 Cal. App. 4th 1315, 1325 (2008): Block billing "makes it difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the time spent on each task was reasonable."

---

## Step 5: Identify Vague Descriptions (45-60 minutes)

### What Are Vague Descriptions?

Time entries lacking sufficient detail to allow court to determine whether time was reasonably expended.

### Red Flags:
- Generic phrases: "case preparation," "work on file," "update file"
- No specifics: "client communication" (phone? email? what was discussed?)
- No purpose: "review notes" (which notes? why? when?)
- Administrative tasks without context

### Examples from Kirk Kolodji Case:

**Vague Entry #1:**
> "Update File" (0.1 hours, $12.50)
- Problem: No specificity whatsoever
- What was updated? Why? What documents?

**Vague Entry #2:**
> "Review notes from hearing on October 15, 2025 concerning exhibits introduced into evidence" (0.3 hours, $105)
- Problem: Why review 22 days after hearing? For what purpose?
- Context: This was 8 days AFTER attorney termination

### Acceptable vs. Vague:

| Vague | Acceptable |
|-------|------------|
| "Case preparation" | "Prepare outline of custody arguments for Nov 19 hearing, review CA Family Code §3020 re: best interest factors" |
| "Client communication" | "Phone call with client (15 min) re: settlement proposal terms, follow-up email summarizing agreed changes" |
| "Update file" | "Update case management system with Oct 27 court ruling on temporary orders, note next hearing date" |

### How to Audit for Vague Descriptions:

1. Read each description
2. Ask: Can I understand exactly what was done and why?
3. If no specifics (what/why/when/how), mark as vague
4. Check if pattern of vague entries throughout invoice
5. Apply 20% reduction for vague descriptions

### Legal Authority:
*Ketchum v. Moses*, 24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1132 (2001): "Time entries must be sufficiently detailed to allow the court to determine whether the time was reasonably expended."

---

## Step 6: Compare to Industry Standards (90-120 minutes)

### What Is Excessive Time?

Time billed for routine tasks significantly exceeds what competent attorney would reasonably spend.

### How to Research Industry Standards:

**Method 1: State Bar Guidelines**
- California State Bar publishes fee guidelines
- Check your jurisdiction's bar association website
- Look for "reasonable fee" guidance or ethics opinions

**Method 2: Compare to Market Rates**
- Research comparable attorneys in your area
- Check Avvo, Martindale, or attorney websites for rates
- Ask other attorneys for informal quotes

**Method 3: Use This Toolkit's Reference**
[Industry Standards Reference Guide](industry-standards-reference.md)

### Common Task Standards (California Family Law):

| Task | Standard Time | Kirk Kolodji Billed | Excess |
|------|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| Initial consultation | 1.5-2.0 hours | 3.0 hours | 1.0-1.5 hours |
| Income & Expense Declaration (FL-150) | 1.0-1.5 hours | 2.3 hours | 0.8-1.3 hours |
| Keech Declaration (Borson motion) | 1.5-2.0 hours | 2.7 hours | 0.7-1.2 hours |
| DVRO application | 3.5-4.5 hours | 5.5 hours | 1.0-2.0 hours |
| Simple motion (RFO) | 3.0-4.0 hours | 5.2 hours | 1.2-2.2 hours |
| Email to client (routine) | 0.1-0.2 hours | 0.3 hours | 0.1-0.2 hours |

### How to Audit for Excessive Time:

1. Identify each major task in invoice
2. Research industry standard time for that task
3. Compare billed time to standard
4. If 30%+ over standard, mark as excessive
5. Calculate excess amount (billed minus standard)
6. Apply 100% reduction of excess amount

### Important Note:
Inefficiency is attorney's problem, not client's. Client should not pay for attorney's learning curve or poor time management.

---

## Step 7: Check for Unauthorized Work (30-45 minutes)

### What Is Unauthorized Work?

Work performed outside scope of representation, after termination, or without client consent.

### Types to Look For:

**1. Post-Termination Work**
- Date of termination (check MC-050 or termination letter)
- Any invoices dated after termination?
- Was work necessary to protect client interests?
- Or was it for attorney's own benefit?

**Example from Kirk Kolodji:**
- Termination: October 29, 2025
- Invoice entry: November 6, 2025
- Task: "Draft Declaration of Kirk A. Kolodji... concerning Borson"
- Analysis: Billing client for work to collect fees from client = unjustified

**2. Scope Creep**
- Compare work to retainer agreement scope
- Was client consulted about expanded work?
- Did client authorize additional services?

**3. Excessive Administrative Tasks**
- Billing for tasks that should be non-billable
- Examples: Office administration, billing prep, file organization

### How to Audit for Unauthorized Work:

1. Review retainer agreement (scope of representation)
2. Check for termination date (if applicable)
3. Compare invoice dates to representation period
4. Flag any post-termination entries
5. Apply 100% reduction for unauthorized work

---

## Step 8: Document Communication Failures (30 minutes)

### Why This Matters:

Rule 1.5(a) considers "the nature and length of the professional relationship" when assessing reasonableness. Poor communication demonstrates substandard relationship quality.

### Evidence to Gather:

**1. Unanswered Emails**
- Client emails requesting information
- Attorney's failure to respond within reasonable time
- Impact on case (missed deadlines, poor strategy)

**Example from Kirk Kolodji:**
- October 26: Nuha sends email with 3 urgent requests
- Kirk's response: None (never answered)
- Kirk's action: Filed motions next day without responding
- Impact: Client terminated representation due to communication failure

**2. Ignored Phone Calls**
- Unreturned voicemails
- Missed scheduled calls
- Pattern of unavailability

**3. Last-Minute Notifications**
- Attorney doesn't inform client of hearings/deadlines
- Client learns of important developments from court, not attorney
- Rushed preparation due to attorney delay

### How This Affects Fees:

While communication failures don't directly reduce specific line items, they demonstrate:
- Substandard representation quality
- Justification for termination
- Basis for overall fee reduction (3-10% of total)

---

## Step 9: Check for Professional Errors (45-60 minutes)

### What Are Professional Errors?

Attorney mistakes causing client harm, demonstrating incompetence or negligence.

### Examples to Look For:

**1. Factual Errors on Court Forms**
- Incorrect information reported
- Client's explicit instructions ignored
- Impact on case outcome

**Kirk Kolodji Example:**
- Error: Reported $5,500/month income on FL-150
- Client instruction: Report $0 (unemployed)
- Impact: "Significantly undermines my spousal support case"

**2. Missed Deadlines**
- Failed to file documents on time
- Missed statute of limitations
- Lost rights or remedies

**3. Inadequate Legal Research**
- Wrong law cited
- Obsolete cases used
- Failed to find controlling authority

**4. Poor Strategic Decisions**
- Actions contrary to client's interests
- Failure to pursue obvious claims
- Settling without client authorization

### How This Affects Fees:

Rule 1.5(a)(6) considers "results obtained." Errors causing harm justify fee reduction:
- Minor errors: 5-15% reduction
- Major errors: 15-30% reduction
- Malpractice: 30-100% reduction + separate claim

---

## Step 10: Calculate Total Impact (60 minutes)

### Summary Calculation Template:

```
TOTAL CLAIMED: $16,306.42

VIOLATION CATEGORY REDUCTIONS:
1. Block Billing (15 entries):
   - Amount affected: $4,200-5,000
   - Reduction (30%): $1,260-1,500

2. Vague Descriptions (10 entries):
   - Amount affected: $2,500-3,750
   - Reduction (20%): $500-750

3. Excessive Time (8 entries):
   - Excess amount: $2,000-3,000
   - Reduction (100% of excess): $2,000-3,000

4. Post-Termination Work (2 entries):
   - Total amount: $630
   - Reduction (100%): $630

5. Communication Failures (pattern):
   - Total representation: $16,306
   - Reduction (5%): $815

6. Professional Errors (1-2 major):
   - Total representation: $16,306
   - Reduction (10%): $1,631

TOTAL REDUCTIONS: $6,836-8,326

JUSTIFIED AMOUNT: $7,980-9,470

RECOMMENDED RANGE: $7,000-9,000
```

### Adjustment Factors:

**Increase justified amount if:**
- Complex case requiring specialized expertise
- Excellent results obtained
- Emergency or rush work necessary
- Attorney highly experienced in specialty

**Decrease justified amount if:**
- Simple, routine case
- Poor results or client harm
- Attorney inexperienced in practice area
- Multiple ethical violations

---

## Step 11: Prepare Evidence Package (60-90 minutes)

### What to Include:

**1. Billing Audit Spreadsheet**
- Complete line-by-line analysis
- Color-coded violations
- Summary totals
- Comparison to industry standards

**2. Violation Examples Document**
- 3-5 examples of each violation type
- Quote exact invoice language
- Explain why it's a violation
- Cite legal authority

**3. Communication Failure Timeline**
- Chronological list of client communications
- Attorney's response (or lack thereof)
- Impact on case

**4. Industry Standards Comparison**
- Table comparing billed time vs. standard for major tasks
- Sources for standards (State Bar, market research)

**5. Supporting Documents**
- Invoices (originals)
- Retainer agreement
- Email communications
- Court filings

---

## Step 12: Determine Next Steps (30 minutes)

### Three Options:

**Option A: Settlement Negotiation**
- Send demand letter with billing audit
- Propose justified amount as settlement
- Negotiate reduction without litigation
- **Best if:** Violations clear, attorney reasonable, time-sensitive

**Option B: Opposition Brief (Litigation)**
- Draft formal legal brief citing violations
- Attach evidence package as exhibits
- File with court before hearing
- **Best if:** Settlement fails, stakes high, strong violations

**Option C: State Bar Complaint**
- Document ethical violations
- File complaint with State Bar
- Seek systemic accountability
- **Best if:** Egregious conduct, pattern of abuse, public interest

### Decision Matrix:

| Factor | Settlement | Opposition Brief | State Bar |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Time investment | Low (5-10 hrs) | High (15-25 hrs) | Medium (10-15 hrs) |
| Attorney needed? | Recommended | Highly recommended | Optional |
| Success rate | 60-80% | 70-90% | 20-40% (discipline) |
| Timeline | 2-4 weeks | 4-8 weeks | 6-12 months |
| Cost | Low ($0-2,000) | Medium ($2,000-8,000) | Low ($0-1,000) |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Emotional Arguments
- Focus on facts and legal standards
- Avoid personal attacks on attorney
- Let violations speak for themselves

### ❌ Mistake #2: Incomplete Analysis
- Audit every line item, not just obvious violations
- Calculate total impact across all categories
- Show pattern, not isolated instances

### ❌ Mistake #3: No Industry Standards
- Don't rely on gut feeling about excessive time
- Research actual standards in your jurisdiction
- Cite sources for comparisons

### ❌ Mistake #4: Ignoring Small Violations
- Small violations add up (10 × $50 = $500)
- Pattern matters more than individual amounts
- Systematic issues show unreasonable practices

### ❌ Mistake #5: DIY Legal Brief
- Attorney review essential before filing
- Pro per briefs often lack legal precision
- Investment in attorney review worth cost
