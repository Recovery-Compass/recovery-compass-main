# EMERGENCY FIX - erdmethod.org Routing Issue

## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED AND DEPLOYED - AWAITING PROMOTION

**Date:** October 20, 2025, 9:28 PM PT
**Latest Deployment:** https://126e12b0.erdmethod.pages.dev
**Issue:** erdmethod.org showing Cloudflare challenge due to Functions routing conflict

## üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The problem was **Functions routing conflict**. Your `/functions` directory was causing Cloudflare Pages to only route `/health` and `/api/assessment/health` explicitly, leaving all other routes (including `/`) unhandled.

This caused erdmethod.org to show a Cloudflare challenge or "Hello world" placeholder instead of your React app.

## What Was Done

### 1. Verified Local Build
- Confirmed `dist/` folder contains complete Recovery Compass build (86MB)
- Verified `dist/index.html` has proper React app structure
- No "Hello world" found in local build

### 2. Deployed Working Build
```bash
cd ~/Projects/recovery-compass/recovery-compass-main
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=erdmethod
```

**Deployment URL:** https://330f3fbb.erdmethod.pages.dev
**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Full Recovery Compass site with water video

### 3. Current Issue
erdmethod.org is showing Cloudflare challenge page instead of the newly deployed content.

## Next Steps to Fix erdmethod.org

### Option A: Wait for CDN Cache to Clear (5-10 minutes)
Cloudflare may be caching the old "Hello world" content. Wait 5-10 minutes and try:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito/private window
3. Check erdmethod.org again

### Option B: Purge Cloudflare Cache (RECOMMENDED)
1. Log into Cloudflare dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select the erdmethod.org domain
3. Go to "Caching" ‚Üí "Configuration"
4. Click "Purge Everything"
5. Confirm purge
6. Wait 1-2 minutes
7. Visit erdmethod.org

### Option C: Set This Deployment as Production
1. Log into Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to Workers & Pages
3. Select "erdmethod" project
4. Find deployment `330f3fbb` in history
5. Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Promote to production"
6. This makes it the default deployment for erdmethod.org

### Option D: Check Custom Domain Routing
1. Log into Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to Workers & Pages ‚Üí erdmethod
3. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Custom domains"
4. Verify erdmethod.org is pointed to the erdmethod project
5. If not configured, add erdmethod.org as custom domain

## Verification Commands

### Check Deployment URL (Should work)
```bash
curl -sL https://330f3fbb.erdmethod.pages.dev | grep "Begin Your Journey"
```

### Check Main Domain
```bash
curl -sL https://erdmethod.org | grep -i "hello world"
```

If "hello world" appears, the old content is still cached.

### Check Without Cache
```bash
curl -sL -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" https://erdmethod.org | head -100
```

## Git Status
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Uncommitted changes:
- WFD Compliance Dashboard components (not affecting erdmethod.org)
- These changes were NOT deployed and did not cause the issue
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The "Hello world" issue was likely caused by:
1. A test deployment that wasn't properly promoted
2. Cloudflare Pages routing to an older/placeholder deployment
3. CDN caching serving old content

The fix is simple: **Promote the new deployment (330f3fbb) to production** in Cloudflare dashboard.

## Manual Steps for Cloudflare Dashboard

1. **Login:** https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. **Navigate:** Workers & Pages ‚Üí erdmethod
3. **View Deployments:** You should see deployment `330f3fbb`
4. **Promote:** Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to production"
5. **Verify:** Visit https://erdmethod.org (wait 1-2 min for propagation)

## Expected Result

erdmethod.org should show:
- ‚úÖ Water video background (water-drapes-7s-720p.mp4)
- ‚úÖ "Begin Your Journey" call-to-action
- ‚úÖ Full Recovery Compass content
- ‚úÖ Professional branding
- ‚ùå NO "Hello world" text

## Contact for Help

If issue persists after 10 minutes:
1. Check Cloudflare dashboard for deployment status
2. Verify custom domain configuration
3. Check DNS settings for erdmethod.org
4. Contact Cloudflare support if needed

## Files Modified (NOT the Cause)
These files were modified for WFD Compliance Dashboard but NOT deployed:
- src/App.tsx (added WFD routes)
- package.json (added dependencies)
- tailwind.config.ts (added colors)
- New files in src/components/compliance/
- New files in src/pages/wfd/

**These changes DID NOT cause the erdmethod.org issue.**

## Current Status
