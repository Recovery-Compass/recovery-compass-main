## 🎯 Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues (Immediate Action)
- ❌ TypeScript strict mode disabled
- ❌ ESLint rules weakened  
- 🔴 88 console statements in production code
- ⚠️ Hardcoded Supabase keys (publishable, but should be in .env)

### High Priority Issues
- 📦 6 components over 300 lines (largest: 876 lines)
- 📁 Inconsistent component organization
- 📤 Mixed export patterns (58 default, 19 named)
- 📝 Minimal type definitions (1 file)

### Medium Priority Issues
- 💾 Direct localStorage usage (no abstraction)
- 🗄️ Archive folder bloat (221KB, 18 files)
- 🪝 Limited custom hooks (only 3)
- 🔤 Inconsistent hook naming (kebab vs camel)

## ✅ Quick Wins (Do Today - 1-2 hours)

Run these commands to get started:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/Projects/recovery-compass/recovery-compass-main

# Run interactive quick wins check
./scripts/quick-wins.sh

# Remove console statements (automated)
./scripts/cleanup-console-logs.sh

# Create local environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
nano .env.local  # Add your keys

# Test everything works
npm run dev
npm run build

# Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "chore(cleanup): execute quick wins - remove console logs, add .env.example"
```

## 📈 Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Health Score | 6.0/10 | 8.5/10 | +42% |
| Console Logs | 88 | 0 | -100% |
| TypeScript Strict | ❌ Off | ✅ On | +Type Safety |
| Avg Component Size | 176 LOC | <150 LOC | +15% |
| Test Coverage | 0% | >60% | +60% |
| Type Coverage | ~30% | >90% | +60% |
| ESLint Errors | 50+ | <10 | -80% |

## 📅 Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1: Code Quality Foundation (4-8 hours)
- Remove all console statements ✅ (script ready)
- Enable TypeScript strict mode (incremental)
- Re-enable ESLint rules
- Setup environment variables ✅ (.env.example ready)
- Delete archive folder ✅ (script checks safety)

**Deliverable:** Clean, strictly-typed codebase

### Week 2: Component Cleanup (12-16 hours)
- Break down 6 large components into smaller ones
- Reorganize into feature-based structure
- Standardize to named exports
- Add barrel exports

**Deliverable:** Well-organized, maintainable components

### Week 3: Architecture (8-12 hours)
- Centralize type definitions
- Extract common patterns into custom hooks
- Create storage abstraction layer
- Build services layer for business logic

**Deliverable:** Solid architectural foundation

### Week 4: Testing & Polish (12-16 hours)
- Add JSDoc comments to public APIs
- Setup Vitest testing infrastructure
- Write tests for critical flows (>60% coverage)
- Setup Prettier + pre-commit hooks

**Deliverable:** Tested, documented codebase

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Full Week 1 Plan
```bash
# Day 1: Quick wins
./scripts/quick-wins.sh
./scripts/cleanup-console-logs.sh
git commit -m "chore: quick wins complete"

# Day 2-3: TypeScript strict mode (incremental)
# Edit tsconfig.app.json, enable one rule at a time
# See QUICK_START_CLEANUP.md for step-by-step guide

# Day 4: ESLint rules
# Edit eslint.config.js, re-enable strict rules
# See CLEANUP_ACTION_PLAN.md Task 1.2

# Day 5: Review and test
npm run build
npm run lint
# Manual testing
```

### Option 2: Just Quick Wins (Today)
```bash
./scripts/quick-wins.sh
./scripts/cleanup-console-logs.sh
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with real keys
npm run dev
npm run build
git commit -m "chore: quick wins - remove console logs, add .env"
```

### Option 3: Cherry Pick Tasks
See CLEANUP_ACTION_PLAN.md for individual tasks with time estimates.
