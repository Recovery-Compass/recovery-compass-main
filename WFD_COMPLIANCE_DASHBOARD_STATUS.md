  - `/wfd/compliance/clients` - Client data table
  - `/wfd/compliance/programs` - Program performance
  - `/wfd/compliance/quality` - Data quality

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Vite Installation Issue
The project has a persistent issue with vite not being found despite being in package.json. This appears to be an environment/node_modules issue.

**To resolve:**
1. Ensure Node.js version is >= 18.0.0
2. Clear all caches: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .vite-temp`
3. Install fresh: `npm install`
4. If still failing, try: `npm install vite@5.4.20 --save-dev --force`

## 📋 TESTING CHECKLIST

Once vite is working, test the following:

### File Upload
- [ ] Drag-and-drop Excel file works
- [ ] CSV file upload works
- [ ] Validation catches missing columns
- [ ] Empty file shows error message
- [ ] Data preview displays correctly

### Metrics Calculation
- [ ] Total clients count is accurate
- [ ] Active enrollments (null ExitDate) correct
- [ ] Housing placements count accurate
- [ ] Average LoS calculates correctly
- [ ] Placement rate percentage correct

### Data Table
- [ ] All records display
- [ ] Sorting works on all columns
- [ ] Program filter works
- [ ] ClientID search works
- [ ] Pagination functions correctly
- [ ] Export to CSV downloads correctly

### Data Quality
- [ ] Field coverage percentages accurate
- [ ] Color coding (red/yellow/green) correct
- [ ] Missing records list displays
- [ ] Overall compliance status accurate
- [ ] Critical issues flag when coverage < 80%

### Navigation
- [ ] All tabs accessible
- [ ] Active tab highlights correctly
- [ ] Browser back/forward work
- [ ] Direct URL access works

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Mobile view works
- [ ] Tablet view works
- [ ] Desktop view optimized
- [ ] Tables scroll horizontally on small screens

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

Once testing passes:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Verify production:**
   - Test file upload
   - Verify calculations
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - Confirm brand styling

## 📊 SAMPLE DATA FOR TESTING

Create a sample Excel file with these columns:
- ClientID
- ProgramName (Ted's Place, Hondo, Pathway Home, Midvale, A2C, ICMS)
- IntakeDate (ISO format: 2024-01-15)
- ExitDate (ISO format or blank for active)
- ExitDestination (Permanent Housing, Self-Exit, etc.)
- HousingPlacementDate (ISO format or blank)
- LengthOfStay (number in days or blank for auto-calc)

Include ~30 records with:
- Mix of active and exited clients
- All 6 programs represented
- Some missing IntakeDate (to test validation)
- Some missing ExitDestination (to test validation)
- Various exit destinations

## 🎯 KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

1. **Dynamic File Upload** - No more hardcoded data
2. **Real-time Calculations** - All metrics computed on upload
3. **MOU Compliance Tracking** - 80% threshold validation
4. **Program Comparison** - Side-by-side performance view
5. **Data Filtering** - By program and client ID
6. **Export Functionality** - Download filtered data as Excel
7. **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
8. **Brand Integration** - WFD colors and styling
9. **Empty States** - Clear guidance when no data uploaded
10. **Error Handling** - Validation messages for bad data

## 📝 USAGE WORKFLOW

**For Jacob (Monthly Updates):**
1. Go to `/wfd/compliance`
2. Drag Housing Tracker Excel file to upload zone
3. Review overview metrics automatically calculated
4. Navigate to Data Quality tab to check MOU compliance
5. Fix any red/yellow fields in source data if needed
6. Export cleaned data or generate reports as needed

**For Randall (Program Oversight):**
1. Navigate to Program Performance tab
2. Compare all programs side-by-side
3. Identify top performers (trophy icon)
4. Review placement rates and length of stay
5. Use data for board presentations

**For Dr. Gallup (Compliance Review):**
1. Navigate to Data Quality tab
2. Review overall compliance status (PASS/FAIL)
3. Check critical issues section
4. Review field coverage percentages
5. Verify IntakeDate and ExitDestination ≥ 80%

## 🔑 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Dashboard is successful when:
- ✅ All components build without errors
- ✅ File upload works flawlessly
- ✅ Calculations match manual verification
- ✅ MOU compliance status is clear
- ✅ Team prefers it over manual spreadsheets
- ✅ Reduces compliance reporting time by 80%

## 📞 SUPPORT RESOURCES

**For Build Issues:**
- Check node version: `node --version` (needs >= 18.0.0)
- Clear caches: `rm -rf node_modules .vite-temp`
- Fresh install: `npm install`

**For Data Issues:**
- Verify column names match exactly
- Check date format (ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD)
- Ensure ClientID is unique per record
- Verify ExitDestination values for placements

**For Calculation Issues:**
- Placement rate = (Permanent Housing exits / total exits) × 100
- Active = null ExitDate
- Average LoS = mean of all LengthOfStay values
- Data quality threshold = 80% for critical fields
