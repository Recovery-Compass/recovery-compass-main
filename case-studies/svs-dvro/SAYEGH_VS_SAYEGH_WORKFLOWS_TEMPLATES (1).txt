5-BIRD PLATFORM WORKFLOWS EXTRACTED FROM SVS CASE STUDY
Session Date: November 5-6, 2025
Case: Sayegh v. Sayegh 25PDFL01441
Extraction: Replicable workflows, templates, and prompts


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


WORKFLOW 1: STRATEGIC GAP ANALYSIS (Theoretical vs. Practical Rating)


Purpose: Identify disconnect between theoretical case strength and observable client stress


Input Triggers:
- Client shows visible stress despite high theoretical rating
- Observable reality contradicts strategic assessment
- Opponent behavior suggests missed vulnerabilities


Execution Steps:
1. Scan current case rating assumptions (what theoretical rating assumes)
2. Compare against observable reality (client stress, physical vulnerabilities)
3. Identify specific gaps (security, force multipliers, opponent reassessment)
4. Quantify gap in points (101 theoretical - 82 practical = 19 points)
5. Create 72-hour deployment sequence to close gaps
6. Recalibrate rating with practical maximum


Output Deliverables:
- Gap analysis JSON with specific vulnerabilities identified
- 72-hour urgent action sequence with costs and timelines
- Force multiplier activation matrix (10+ opportunities)
- Rating recalibration path (practical maximum restoration)


Template Location: SVS_CRITICAL_GAP_ANALYSIS_NOV5_2025.json


Replication Value: ANY case where theoretical rating doesn't match client observable state


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


WORKFLOW 2: OPPONENT REASSESSMENT (Critical Discovery Integration)


Purpose: Update threat assessment when new opponent intelligence emerges


Input Triggers:
- New opponent background discovered (disbarment, discipline, criminal history)
- Observable opponent behavior shifts (desperation, irrational actions)
- Cross-state victim patterns emerge (federal jurisdiction potential)


Execution Steps:
1. Web search opponent professional status (State Bar, USPTO, court records)
2. Identify threat level escalation factors (disbarment = desperate behavior)
3. Update behavioral prediction model (rational → irrational escalation likely)
4. Integrate cross-state victim evidence (RICO pattern establishment)
5. Recalibrate force multiplier opportunities (additional discipline complaints)
6. Adjust child protection protocols (enhanced threat = enhanced security)


Output Deliverables:
- Opponent threat profile update (Freddy disbarred 2025 = CRITICAL level)
- Behavioral prediction shift documentation
- Enhanced force multiplier matrix (CA Bar UPL + USPTO federal discipline)
- Child protection enhancement recommendations


Template Location: SVS_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF_CRITICAL_GAPS_NOV5.md

3. Implement school safety protocol (pickup authorization, no-contact enforcement)
4. Install location tracking apps (Life360 family safety, Citizen crime alerts)
5. Create emergency response protocol (who to call, evidence documentation)
6. Calculate total cost (typically $300-500 one-time + $15-30/month)


Output Deliverables:
- Physical security deployment checklist ($300 Ring + SimpliSafe)
- School district safety protocol template (pickup authorization)
