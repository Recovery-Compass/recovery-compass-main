**Subject:** Sean Kolodji (Kirk's brother)  
**Role:** Identified as "paralegal" in case communications  
**Issue:** Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) exposure  
**Impact:** Additional $2,000-5,000 fee reduction if UPL confirmed

---

## Executive Summary

Sean Kolodji (Kirk Kolodji's brother) participated extensively in October 6 and October 14, 2025 meetings with Nuha Sayegh, providing legal advice and case strategy guidance.

## Legal Standards: Paralegal vs. UPL

### Proper Paralegal Practice
**Requirements:**
1. **Supervision:** Work performed under attorney's direct supervision
2. **Disclosure:** Client informed of paralegal status and rates
3. **Scope:** Tasks delegated must be appropriate for paralegal
4. **Billing:** Paralegal time billed at paralegal rate ($75-150/hr), not attorney rate ($350-450/hr)

### Unauthorized Practice of Law
**Prohibited Activities for Non-Attorneys:**
1. Giving legal advice
2. Representing clients in legal matters
3. Preparing legal documents without supervision
4. Setting legal fees
5. Establishing attorney-client relationship

---

## Verification Required

### California Paralegal Registration
**Search Required:** California State Bar Paralegal Database

**Search Steps:**
1. Visit: https://apps.calbar.ca.gov/attorney/LicenseeSearch/QuickSearch
2. Search: "Sean Kolodji" OR "Kolodji, Sean"
3. Check: Active paralegal certificate or business entity registration
4. Document: License number, expiration date, supervising attorney

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **If Licensed:** Document paralegal credentials; verify Kirk disclosed paralegal rates
- **If NOT Licensed:** UPL violation confirmed; significant fee reduction justified

---

## UPL Impact on Fee Request

### If Sean Is NOT Licensed/Registered

**Legal Consequences:**
1. **Kirk's Liability:** Attorney responsible for supervising non-attorneys
2. **Billing Fraud:** Charging attorney rates for unlicensed work
3. **Ethical Violation:** Business and Professions Code § 6125 (UPL enabling)
4. **Fee Reduction:** $2,000-5,000 additional reduction justified

**Opposition Brief Argument:**
> Kirk Kolodji allowed his brother Sean Kolodji to participate extensively in attorney-client meetings, providing legal advice and case strategy guidance. If Sean is not a properly licensed paralegal working under Kirk's supervision, this constitutes Unauthorized Practice of Law. At minimum, any fees associated with Sean's participation should be disallowed. Kirk cannot charge attorney rates for unlicensed individuals providing legal services.

### If Sean IS Licensed But Rates Not Disclosed

**Issue:** Even if Sean is licensed, Kirk must disclose paralegal billing separately

**California Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5:**
> Fee agreement must disclose billing rates for attorneys, paralegals, and other personnel.

**Fee Reduction Calculation:**
- Sean's estimated involvement: 4-6 hours across two meetings
- Attorney rate charged: $350/hour × 5 hours = $1,750
- Paralegal rate appropriate: $100/hour × 5 hours = $500
- **Excess billing:** $1,250

### If Sean IS Licensed AND Rates Properly Disclosed

**Outcome:** No UPL issue, move on to other violations

**Note:** Given Kirk's pattern of disclosure failures (Rule 1.8.6, Rule 4.2, Rule 1.4), proper paralegal disclosure is unlikely.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Action (Nov 7-9, 2025)
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Time Required:** 30-60 minutes  
**Responsible Party:** Sara Memari or paralegal

**Task:** Verify Sean Kolodji's paralegal status

**Method 1: Online Search**
1. California State Bar paralegal database
2. California Paralegal Association (CAPA) directory
3. Google search: "Sean Kolodji paralegal California"

**Method 2: Declaration Request**
1. Demand Kirk provide Sean's paralegal credentials in discovery
2. If Kirk cannot produce → UPL presumption strengthened

**Method 3: Third-Party Verification**
1. Contact Kolodji Family Law, PC directly
2. Request: "Please confirm Sean Kolodji's paralegal license number and supervising attorney"

### If UPL Confirmed: Opposition Brief Section

**Heading:** Sean Kolodji's Unlicensed Participation

**Body:**
> Kirk Kolodji's brother, Sean Kolodji, participated extensively in the October 6 and October 14, 2025 attorney-client meetings, providing legal advice, case strategy guidance, and procedural recommendations. 
>
> A search of the California State Bar paralegal database reveals no active paralegal license for Sean Kolodji. Under Business and Professions Code § 6125, only licensed attorneys and properly supervised paralegals may provide legal advice. Kirk's use of an unlicensed individual to provide legal services constitutes:
>
> 1. **Unauthorized Practice of Law** (B&P § 6125)
> 2. **Ethical Violation** (Rule 1.1 - Competence; Rule 5.3 - Non-Lawyer Assistance)
> 3. **Billing Fraud** (charging attorney rates for unlicensed work)
>
> At minimum, all fees associated with Sean's participation—estimated at $1,750-2,500—should be disallowed. Moreover, Kirk's systematic violations (UPL, Rule 1.4, Rule 1.5, Rule 1.8.6, Rule 4.2) demonstrate a pattern of misconduct justifying denial of the entire fee motion.

**Exhibit:** Declaration stating results of paralegal license search

### If Licensed But Not Disclosed: Fee Adjustment

**Argument:**
> While Sean Kolodji holds a valid paralegal license, Kirk's invoices do not separately disclose paralegal rates or identify which work was performed by Sean versus Kirk. This violates Rule 1.5's requirement for fee transparency. Sean's estimated 4-6 hours of work should be reimbursed at paralegal rates ($100/hour) rather than attorney rates ($350/hour), reducing the fee request by $1,250-1,500.

## State Bar Complaint Implications

### If UPL Confirmed
**Violations to Report:**
1. **Rule 5.3(a):** "Lawyer must make reasonable efforts to ensure firm's conduct compatible with professional obligations"
2. **Rule 5.3(b):** "Lawyer with direct supervisory authority over non-lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure person's conduct compatible with lawyer's professional obligations"
3. **Business & Professions Code § 6125:** Enabling unauthorized practice of law

**Severity:** HIGH (UPL is serious ethical violation with potential criminal penalties)
