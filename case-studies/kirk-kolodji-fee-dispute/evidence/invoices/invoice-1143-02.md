## Legal Analysis: Post-Termination Work

### Issue:
Can an attorney bill a client for work performed after termination, specifically for drafting the attorney's own fee motion?

### California Law:
Once attorney-client relationship terminates, attorney cannot continue billing unless:
1. Client explicitly authorizes continued work, OR
2. Work is necessary to protect client's interests

### Application to This Case:
- ❌ No client authorization for post-termination work
- ❌ Work was NOT to protect client's interests
- ✅ Work was to pursue attorney's own fee collection

### Circular Billing Problem:
Kirk is billing Nuha for work to collect fees from Nuha's spouse. This creates a circular logic:
- Kirk claims $16,306 in fees
- $630 of that amount is for drafting the motion seeking $16,306
- Client pays for attorney's self-serving fee collection efforts

### Legal Standard:
Retainer agreement's Borson clause authorizes Kirk to **seek** fees from opposing party. It does NOT authorize Kirk to **bill the client** for the work of seeking those fees.

---

## Additional Billing Violations

### Block Billing (5 entries)
Entry combining Declaration drafting + Memorandum drafting + E-filing + Service into single 1.5-hour block.

Industry standard: Each task should be itemized separately:
- Declaration drafting: 0.5-0.8 hours
- Memorandum drafting: 0.5-0.8 hours
- E-filing: 0.1-0.2 hours
- Service: 0.1-0.2 hours

### Vague Description (2 entries)
"Review notes from hearing" - Which notes? For what purpose? This review was conducted 22 days after the hearing and 8 days after termination.

---

## Pre-Termination Work (October 16-29)

### Legitimate Entries:
The invoice includes several pre-termination entries that may be justified:
- Case management activities
- Client communications
- Document review and filing
- Hearing preparation

### Estimated Breakdown:
- Total invoice amount: $1,832.78
- Post-termination amount: $630.00
- Pre-termination amount: $1,202.78

---

## Analysis

### Total Billed: $1,832.78

### Violation Impact:
- **Post-termination work:** $630.00 (100% unjustified)
- **Block billing reduction (30%):** $150-200
- **Vague description reduction (20%):** $80-120

### Adjusted Justified Amount:
- Original: $1,832.78
- Less post-termination: $1,202.78
- Less violations: $230-320
- **Justified range:** $880-970

---

## Strategic Significance

This invoice is the **smoking gun** for the opposition brief because it demonstrates:

1. **Unauthorized Post-Termination Work:** Clear violation of attorney-client relationship boundaries
2. **Self-Serving Billing:** Charging client for work that benefits attorney, not client
3. **Circular Logic Flaw:** Including fee-collection work in the fee being collected
4. **Pattern of Violations:** Continues block billing and vague descriptions from Invoice #1143-01

---

## Evidence Classification

**PFV v3.0 Tier:** TIER 1 (Official billing record)  
**Admissibility:** Highly admissible (business record)  
**Source:** Kirk Kolodji email to Nuha Sayegh, November 6, 2025  
**Chain of Custody:** Direct from attorney to client  
**Critical Evidence:** Yes (post-termination billing violation)

## Use in Opposition Brief

This invoice should be featured prominently in opposition brief:

### Argument Structure:
**Section: Post-Termination Work Without Authorization**

> "Invoice #1143-02 includes $630 in charges for work performed on November 6, 2025 - eight days after Kirk Kolodji's termination on October 29, 2025. This work consisted solely of drafting Kirk's own fee motion - the very motion now before this Court. Kirk seeks to charge Nuha's spouse for the work of collecting fees from Nuha's spouse. This circular billing violates basic principles of attorney fee reasonableness and should be disallowed in its entirety."

**Supporting Points:**
1. MC-050 Substitution of Attorney filed October 30, 2025 (Exhibit E)
2. No client authorization for post-termination work
3. Work was self-serving (Kirk's fee collection, not client protection)
4. Retainer Borson clause authorizes seeking fees, not billing for that work
