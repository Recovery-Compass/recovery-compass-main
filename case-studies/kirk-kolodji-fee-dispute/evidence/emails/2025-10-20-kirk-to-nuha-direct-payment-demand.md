# Email: Kirk to Nuha - Direct Payment Demand

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**From:** Kirk A. Kolodji <kirk@kolodji familylaw.com>  
**To:** Nuha Sayegh <nuha.sayegh@[redacted]>  
**Subject:** Payment for legal services  
**Violation:** Circumvented third-party payor, created financial pressure

---

## Context

After Eric Jones (third-party financial supporter) requested documentation on October 17, Kirk circumvented Eric and contacted Nuha directly for payment. This demonstrates Kirk's awareness of the third-party payor relationship while simultaneously violating proper disclosure requirements.

---

## Key Content

Kirk demanded payment from Nuha despite:
1. Knowing Eric was designated financial supporter
2. Never obtaining Rule 1.8.6 written disclosure/consent
3. Creating direct financial pressure on DV survivor client

---

## Significance

This email demonstrates:
1. **Deliberate Circumvention:** Kirk bypassed Eric to pressure Nuha
2. **Financial Coercion:** Created stress for vulnerable DV survivor
3. **Rule 1.8.6 Violation:** No proper third-party payor disclosure
4. **Pattern Evidence:** Part of systematic communication failures

---

## Legal Violations

**Rule 1.8.6 (Third-Party Payor):**
Kirk acknowledged third-party payor relationship (by circumventing Eric) but failed to comply with disclosure requirements.

**Rule 1.4 (Communication):**
Communicated about fees but failed to provide requested case documentation.

---

## Strategic Value

**Opposition Brief:** Demonstrates Kirk's awareness of third-party payor relationship, undermining any claim he didn't know Eric was paying.

**Fee Reduction Argument:** Financial pressure tactics support argument that fees are unreasonable and representation was problematic.

---

## Admissible Evidence Status

✅ **ADMISSIBLE:** Written email communication

**PFV v3.0 Confidence:** 90% (clear circumvention pattern)
