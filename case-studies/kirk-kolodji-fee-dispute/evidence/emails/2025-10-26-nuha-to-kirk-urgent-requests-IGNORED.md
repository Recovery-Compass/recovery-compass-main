# October 26, 2025 Email - Urgent Client Requests (IGNORED)

**From:** Nuha Sayegh  
**To:** Kirk A. Kolodji, Esq.  
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Subject:** Urgent: Monday Meeting Confirmation + Income Declaration Error + Lis Pendens Status  
**Response Status:** ❌ **NEVER ANSWERED**

---

## Email Summary

This email represents a critical communication failure in Kirk Kolodji's representation. Nuha sent three urgent requests requiring immediate attorney response:

1. **Monday meeting confirmation** - Client needs logistics
2. **Income & Expense Declaration correction** - Client disputes $5,500/month income reporting
3. **Lis pendens filing status** - $1.1-1.5M Sonoma property protection

Kirk never responded. Instead, he filed three motions on October 27 (one day later) without addressing any of the client's concerns.

---

## Request #1: Meeting Confirmation

**Client Question:** "Can you confirm the details for our Monday meeting?"

**Context:** Nuha needed meeting logistics (time, location, purpose) to prepare.

**Kirk's Response:** None

**Impact:** Client left uncertain about meeting arrangements, suggesting poor case management and communication.

---

## Request #2: Income Declaration Error (CRITICAL)

**Client Statement (paraphrased from source documents):**
> "I ABSOLUTELY do not make that amount... I don't have SHIT... Kirk submit that I don't have a job!! Because i DONT! This significantly undermines my spousal support case."

**Issue:** Kirk reported $5,500/month income on Nuha's FL-150 (Income & Expense Declaration), despite Nuha's explicit instruction to report $0 income (unemployed).

**Legal Standard:** Attorney must follow client's lawful instructions regarding factual representations on court forms.

**Kirk's Response:** None (never corrected the form)

**Impact:**
- Incorrect income reporting undermines spousal support request
- Court may view Nuha as having $5,500/month income when she has $0
- Potential malpractice: attorney's error causing financial harm to client
- Direct breach of duty to follow client instructions

**Financial Harm:** Incalculable reduction in spousal support award

---

## Request #3: Lis Pendens Status

**Client Question:** "What is the status of the lis pendens filing for the Sonoma property?"

**Context:** 
- Nuha and Fahed own $1.1-1.5M property in Sonoma County
- Lis pendens protects property from transfer during litigation
- Critical to preserve marital asset for division

**Kirk's Response:** None

**Impact:** Client has no information about whether her $1M+ asset is protected. If property was transferred without lis pendens, she could lose significant marital interest.

## Timeline Context

### October 24, 2025 (Two days before)

### October 26, 2025
Nuha sends email explicitly disagreeing with $5,500 income and requesting correction.

### October 27, 2025 (One day after)
Kirk files three motions WITHOUT responding to October 26 email:
1. Income & Expense Declaration (FL-150) - with uncorrected $5,500 income
2. Request for Order (RFO)
3. Additional pleadings

### October 29, 2025 (Three days after)
Nuha terminates Kirk's representation, cites communication failures and income reporting error.

## Legal Analysis

### Rule 1.4: Communication Duty

California Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.4(a)(3) requires attorney to:
> "keep the client reasonably informed about significant developments relating to the representation"

AND Rule 1.4(a)(4) requires attorney to:
> "promptly comply with reasonable requests for information"

**Application:** Kirk violated both provisions by:
1. Failing to respond to three explicit client requests
2. Failing to inform client of decision to ignore income correction request
3. Filing motions without confirming client understood and approved content

### Rule 1.2: Scope of Representation

Rule 1.2(a) requires attorney to:
> "abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation"

**Application:** Income reporting is factual representation affecting case outcome (spousal support). Client's instruction to report $0 income (accurate fact) should have been followed.

### Malpractice Elements

1. **Duty:** Kirk owed Nuha duty of competent representation
2. **Breach:** Failed to follow client instruction on FL-150, ignored urgent email
3. **Causation:** Incorrect income reporting directly undermines spousal support case
4. **Damages:** Reduced spousal support award (quantifiable after hearing)

---

## Strategic Significance for Fee Dispute

This email is **critical evidence** supporting fee reduction because it demonstrates:

### 1. Communication Failure Pattern
Kirk systematically ignored client communications, violating Rule 1.4.

### 2. Quality of Representation
Even if Kirk's time entries were accurate, the quality of representation was substandard. Attorney fees must be reasonable, considering "results obtained" - Kirk's errors harmed client's case.

### 3. Justification for Termination
Client had legitimate grounds to terminate Kirk based on communication failures and professional errors.

### 4. Fee Reduction Factors (Rule 1.5)
Under Rule 1.5, court considers:
- "The nature and length of the professional relationship" - Poor communication throughout
- "The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer" - Competence issues evident
- "The amount involved and the results obtained" - Negative results (FL-150 error)

## Use in Opposition Brief

### Recommended Citation Structure:

**Section: Communication Failures Justify Fee Reduction**

> "On October 26, 2025, Nuha sent Kirk an email with three urgent requests: (1) Monday meeting confirmation, (2) correction of Income & Expense Declaration error, and (3) status of lis pendens filing for $1.1-1.5M Sonoma property. Kirk never responded. Instead, he filed motions on October 27 - including the uncorrected Income & Expense Declaration - without addressing any of Nuha's concerns. (Exhibit C: October 26 Email; Exhibit D: October 27 Court Filings)
>
> This communication failure violates Rule 1.4(a)(3) and (4), which require attorneys to keep clients reasonably informed and promptly comply with reasonable information requests. Moreover, Kirk's failure to correct the income reporting error - despite Nuha's explicit instruction - constitutes professional negligence that 'significantly undermines [Nuha's] spousal support case.' (Exhibit C)
>
> These failures demonstrate substandard representation quality, justifying fee reduction under Rule 1.5's requirement to consider 'results obtained' and attorney 'ability.' Kirk's fees should be reduced to reflect the harm caused by his communication failures and professional errors."

4. Calculate potential spousal support impact of income reporting error
5. Consider malpractice claim separate from fee dispute

**For Eric Jones:**
