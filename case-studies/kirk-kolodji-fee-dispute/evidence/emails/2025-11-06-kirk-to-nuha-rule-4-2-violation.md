# Email: Kirk to Nuha - Rule 4.2 Violation

**Date:** November 6, 2025  
**From:** Kirk A. Kolodji <kirk@kolodji familylaw.com>  
**To:** Nuha Sayegh <nuha.sayegh@[redacted]>  
**CC:** (none - Sara Memari excluded)  
**Subject:** Invoice + Borson fee motion filing  
**Violation:** Communication with represented party (Rule 4.2)

---

## Context

On November 6, 2025, Kirk emailed invoice #1143-02 and Borson fee motion documents directly to Nuha—despite knowing Nuha was represented by Sara Memari (H Bui Law Firm) since October 30, 2025.

---

## Rule 4.2 Violation

**California Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2:**
> "In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer."

**Facts:**
- Kirk knew Nuha was represented (MC-050 filed Oct 30, 2025)
- Kirk emailed Nuha directly on Nov 6 (no CC to Sara)
- Email concerned fee dispute (subject of Sara's representation)
- No evidence Kirk obtained Sara's consent

---

## Significance

This is one of the **most serious ethical violations** in this case because:

1. **Clear Knowledge:** Kirk filed the MC-050 substitution himself, proving he knew Sara was counsel
2. **Deliberate Contact:** Email sent 7 days after substitution
3. **Subject Matter:** Fee dispute directly related to Sara's representation
4. **No Consent:** No evidence Kirk sought or obtained Sara's permission
5. **Pattern Evidence:** Continues October 20 circumvention behavior

---

## Strategic Value

**Opposition Brief:**
- Cite Rule 4.2 violation as separate ground for fee reduction
- Argue Kirk's ethical violations justify denying or reducing fee motion
- Show pattern of improper communication (Oct 20 + Nov 6)

**State Bar Complaint:**
- Rule 4.2 violations are taken very seriously
- Clear, documented, recent violation
- Easy to prove (MC-050 + email + no consent)

---

## Legal Precedent

**Hawk v. State Bar**, 45 Cal.3d 589 (1988):
> Rule 4.2 violations warrant discipline because they interfere with attorney-client relationship and undermine adversary system.

---

## Admissible Evidence Status

✅ **ADMISSIBLE:** Written email + MC-050 court filing  
✅ **PUBLIC RECORD:** MC-050 substitution is court record  
✅ **DOCUMENTARY:** No reliance on recordings or testimony

---

## Recommended Actions

**Immediate (Nov 7-8):**
1. Sara Memari formally objects to Kirk's direct communication
2. Document this violation in opposition brief
3. Reference in State Bar complaint (post-hearing)

**Opposition Brief Section:**
> "On November 6, 2025—seven days after MC-050 substitution—Kirk Kolodji violated Rule 4.2 by emailing Nuha Sayegh directly without counsel's consent. This ethical violation, combined with his October 20 circumvention of third-party payor Eric Jones, demonstrates a pattern of improper communication that undermines his fee request."
