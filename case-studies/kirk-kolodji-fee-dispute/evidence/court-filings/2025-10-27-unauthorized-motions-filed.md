# Court Filings: October 27, 2025 - Unauthorized Motions

**Date Filed:** October 27, 2025  
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles  
**Case:** Sayegh v. Sayegh (25PDFL01441)  
**Filed By:** Kirk A. Kolodji, Esq.  
**Violation:** Filed without responding to October 26 client email

---

## Motions Filed

Kirk Kolodji filed the following motions on October 27, 2025:

1. **Request for Order (RFO)** - Family law matters
2. **Income & Expense Declaration (FL-150)** - Financial disclosure
3. **Additional pleadings** related to dissolution case

---

## Critical Timeline

**October 26, 2025 (Evening):**
- Nuha sends urgent email to Kirk with 3 requests:
  1. Confirm November 1 meeting attendance
  2. Provide lis pendens status update
  3. Correct FL-150 income error ($5,500 vs. $0)

**October 27, 2025 (Next Day):**
- Kirk files motions **without responding** to October 26 email
- No acknowledgment of client's concerns
- No correction of FL-150 error before filing

---

## Legal Violations

### Rule 1.4(a)(3) - Communication Duty
> "A lawyer shall... keep the client reasonably informed about significant developments relating to the representation."

Kirk filed significant motions without:
- Responding to client's urgent questions
- Addressing client's specific concerns about those motions
- Correcting known error in FL-150 before filing

### Rule 1.4(a)(4) - Responsiveness
> "A lawyer shall... promptly comply with reasonable requests for information."

Kirk's timeline shows deliberate non-responsiveness:
- Client requests: Oct 26 evening
- Kirk's action: File motions Oct 27 (less than 24 hours later)
- Kirk's response to client: **NONE**

---

## Significance

This demonstrates Kirk's **pattern of prioritizing his own agenda over client needs:**

1. Client raises urgent concerns → Ignored
2. Client identifies error in filing → Not corrected
3. Kirk proceeds with his plan → Despite client objections
4. Client terminated representation 2 days later → Predictable outcome

---

## Strategic Value

**Opposition Brief:**
> "On October 26, 2025, Nuha emailed Kirk with three urgent requests. Rather than respond, Kirk filed motions the next day without addressing any of her concerns—including a known error in the FL-150 income declaration. This pattern of non-responsiveness justified Nuha's termination of representation on October 29, 2025."

**Fee Reduction Argument:**
- Work done without client approval or response = unreasonable
- Filing with known errors = incompetence
- Ignoring client concerns = communication failure

**Causation for Termination:**
- Kirk's Oct 27 unauthorized filings → Nuha's Oct 29 termination (2 days later)
- Direct causal link between Kirk's conduct and representation breakdown

## Admissible Evidence

✅ **Court Filings:** Public record (docket available)  
✅ **October 26 Email:** Written communication from Nuha  
✅ **Timeline:** Demonstrable sequence of events  
✅ **No Recordings Needed:** Entirely documentary evidence

## Recommended Brief Language

**Heading:** Kirk Filed Motions Without Responding to Client Concerns

**Body:**
> Two days before Kirk filed these motions, Nuha sent an urgent email requesting: (1) confirmation of meeting attendance, (2) lis pendens status update, and (3) correction of a known income reporting error in the FL-150. Rather than respond to any of these concerns, Kirk filed the motions the next day without acknowledging Nuha's email or correcting the error she identified.
>
> This demonstrates Kirk's systematic failure to communicate under Rule 1.4(a)(3)-(4). When an attorney files significant pleadings without responding to the client's specific concerns about those same pleadings, the work cannot be deemed "reasonable" under Rule 1.5. Nuha terminated Kirk's representation two days later—a predictable consequence of his non-responsiveness.
