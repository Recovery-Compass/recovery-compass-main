## Executive Summary

This case study documents a pro per defense against an attorney fee motion filed under California's *Marriage of Borson* precedent. Kirk Kolodji represented Nuha Sayegh in a domestic violence restraining order and dissolution matter for 23 days before being terminated. After termination, Kirk filed a motion seeking $16,306.42 in fees from Nuha's estranged spouse, claiming unpaid attorney fees.

A comprehensive billing audit revealed $8,000-10,000 in unjustified fees across six violation categories:
1. Block billing (combining multiple tasks)
2. Vague descriptions (insufficient detail)
3. Excessive time (above industry standards)
4. Post-termination work (billing for his own fee motion)
5. Communication failures (ignored client emails)
6. Professional conduct violations (multiple Rules of Professional Conduct)

This case serves as the **founding example** for Recovery Compass's Pro Per Defense Toolkit, demonstrating how individuals can effectively challenge unreasonable attorney fees using systematic billing audits and professional legal representation.

## Strategic Approach

### Phase 1: Billing Audit (Completed)
Systematic line-by-line analysis of invoices identifying violations and calculating justified vs. unjustified fees.

### Phase 2: Settlement Proposal (Optional)
Offer to resolve dispute for $6,000-8,000 (justified amount) without litigation.

### Phase 3: Opposition Brief (If settlement fails)
Formal legal brief citing violations with supporting evidence, due November 15, 2025.

### Phase 4: State Bar Complaint (Post-hearing)
If appropriate, file complaint documenting ethical violations for systemic accountability.

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Primary Outcome: Fee Reduction
Court reduces fee award to $6,000-8,000, saving Nuha's spouse $8,000-10,000.

### Secondary Outcome: Professional Accountability
State Bar complaint (if filed) addresses systemic issues with attorney billing practices.

### Tertiary Outcome: Toolkit Development
Case materials transformed into Pro Per Defense Toolkit for future clients facing similar fee disputes.

---

## Lessons Learned

### Professional Boundaries
Chief DV Advocate role must maintain clear boundaries to avoid unauthorized practice of law (UPL) or tortious interference claims.

### Evidence Management
California's two-party consent law (PC 632) requires careful attention to recording consent. When in doubt, rely on written communications and court records.

### Early Documentation
Systematic documentation of communication failures, billing irregularities, and professional conduct issues creates strong foundation for fee disputes.

### Attorney Selection
Third-party financial supporters should verify attorney competence and billing practices before significant financial commitments.
