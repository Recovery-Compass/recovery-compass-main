JJ TRUST PROBATE CASE STUDY
Pro Per Trust Administration + Mortgage Servicer Obstruction
Case Type: Probate Petition (PC 850) + Trust Administration + Mortgage Servicer Obstruction
Decedent: Judy Brakebill Jones (mother, died April 2025)
Successor Trustee: Eric Jones (son, sole beneficiary, appointed trustee)
Trust Asset: Residential property in Los Angeles County (~$1.1M value: $704K lien + $400K equity)
Opponent: Gary Jones (stepfather, non-beneficiary attempting asset conversion) + Shellpoint Mortgage (servicer obstruction)
Timeline: October 30, 2025 (ex parte filing) → November 4, 2025 (rejection) → projected refiling November 8, 2025
Current Status: 🔄 Filing correction in progress (Anuar Ramirez, Seven Hills Law Firm assisting)
Projected Outcome: Property preservation + mortgage reinstatement + Gary Jones asset recovery ($700K+ total value)
Cost: $75–$500 (One Legal Concierge + potential attorney consult)
Traditional Comparison: $15,000–$30,000 probate attorney retainer
Force Multiplier: 30–400x ROI

SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Following the April 2025 death of Judy Brakebill Jones, her son Eric Jones (sole beneficiary and appointed successor trustee per 2008 Revocable Trust) faced dual obstruction: stepfather Gary Jones (non-beneficiary) attempting to claim trust assets, and Shellpoint Mortgage refusing SII (Spouse/Immediate Family) application despite valid successor trustee status.


The property at stake: Los Angeles County residential home with $1.1M value ($704K mortgage, $400K equity), 6 months delinquent ($5,610.36 due), at risk of foreclosure if mortgage not reinstated. Eric filed ex parte PC 850 petition (property recovery from Gary Jones) on October 30, 2025, but all 7 documents rejected November 4, 2025 for CRC 2.111 formatting issues (technical, not substantive).


Coalition Solution: Anuar Ramirez (Seven Hills Law Firm, personal relationship from June guest post + mom's funeral connection) engaged at zero cost to correct formatting. One Legal Concierge ($75 + fees) identified as 48-hour backup if Anuar unavailable. Simultaneously, CFPB complaint filed against Shellpoint (November 3, 2025, ID 251104-25540274) to force SII re-review.


Dual-Track Strategy:


1. Probate Track: PC 850 court order appointing Eric as successor trustee = legal authority to act
2. Mortgage Track: CFPB pressure + court order = Shellpoint forced to accept SII application


Key Insight: Filing rejection is technical, not substantive—correction adds attorney credibility (Anuar's letterhead) at zero cost. This is coalition leverage > transactional service: personal relationship provides professional support traditional attorneys charge $15K-$30K to deliver.

SECTION 2: STRATEGIC CHALLENGE
Multi-Front Complexity
1. Probate Obstruction
Gary Jones (stepfather, non-beneficiary) attempting to claim trust assets despite clear 2008 Revocable Trust language appointing Eric as sole successor trustee. Gary Jones has no legal standing (not named in trust, not beneficiary), but may attempt procedural delays or contest trust validity.


2. Mortgage Servicer Obstruction
Shellpoint Mortgage refusing SII (Spouse/Immediate Family) application despite Eric's valid successor trustee status. Property is 6 months delinquent ($5,610.36 due), but not currently in active foreclosure (no sale date set). Servicer creating administrative barriers to reinstatement.


Shellpoint SII Application Timeline:


* October 2025: Initial SII application submitted (successor trustee documentation provided)
* November 3, 2025: Call with Sonia C. (Shellpoint rep) reveals application denial rationale:
   * Claims "additional documentation needed" (no specifics provided)
   * Circular logic: "Need court order appointing trustee" (but trust document already appoints Eric)
   * Ignores California Probate Code § 18100.5 (successor trustee authority automatic upon death)


3. Foreclosure Risk
Property not currently in foreclosure, but 6 months delinquent creates risk if mortgage not reinstated. Reinstatement quote: $6,540.42 (valid through December 3, 2025). Once SII approved, loss mitigation options available (forbearance, modification). Timeline pressure: must resolve before servicer initiates foreclosure (typically 9-12 months delinquent).


4. E-Filing Technical Barriers
LA County Probate rejected 7 documents for CRC 2.111 formatting issues (California Rules of Court, Rule 2.111: first-page layout requirements). Clerk comment: "refer to california rules of court (rule 2.111) on how to format the first page."


Documents Rejected (November 4, 2025):


1. Ex Parte Application for TRO
2. Petition for PC 850 (Trust Asset Recovery)
3. Memorandum of Points and Authorities
4. Proposed Order
5. Declaration of Eric Jones
6. Exhibits Package
7. Proof of Service


Formatting Issue: CRC 2.111 requires specific first-page layout (attorney info left, clerk space right, court title placement, font/margin specifications). This is technical compliance, not substantive legal deficiency.

Why Traditional Representation is Cost-Prohibitive
Probate Attorney Retainer: $15K-$30K for trust litigation + mortgage servicer negotiation


Cost-Benefit Analysis:


* Property equity: $400K (after paying $704K mortgage)
* Attorney fees: $15K-$30K (retainer) + 10-20% contingency = $55K-$110K total
* Net recovery: $290K-$345K (if property preserved)


Problem: Attorney fees consume 14-28% of equity. Eric as pro per successor trustee can preserve 100% of equity by:


1. Correcting e-filing format (coalition leverage: Anuar at zero cost)
2. Forcing Shellpoint compliance via CFPB pressure ($0 cost)
3. Reinstating mortgage once SII approved ($6,540.42 one-time cost)


________________


Pro Per Advantages
Eric Has Fiduciary Authority:
2008 Revocable Trust appoints Eric as sole successor trustee. California Probate Code § 18100.5 grants automatic authority upon Judy's death—no court appointment needed for most trust administration tasks. PC 850 petition seeks court confirmation (not initial appointment) to establish authority vis-à-vis third parties (Gary Jones, Shellpoint).


Trust Document is Clear:
No ambiguity about beneficiary designation (Eric is sole beneficiary). Gary Jones has zero standing (not named, not beneficiary, not alternative trustee). This is defensive legal posture—Eric doesn't need to prove entitlement, Gary Jones must prove his standing (which doesn't exist).


Mortgage Servicer Obstruction Triggers Regulatory Violations:
Shellpoint's refusal to process SII application violates:


* RESPA Regulation X § 1024.31: Servicer must acknowledge complete loss mitigation application within 5 days
* CFPB Enforcement Policy: SII applications from successor trustees must be processed (Shellpoint can't demand "court order" when trust document provides authority)


E-Filing Technical Issues Solvable via Coalition:
Anuar Ramirez (attorney, personal relationship) engaged to correct CRC 2.111 formatting at zero cost. This transforms technical rejection into credibility enhancement (attorney letterhead increases court filing acceptance rate).

SECTION 3: 5-BIRD DEPLOYMENT
Bird #1: Intelligence (Document Analysis)
Actions Taken:


* Trust Document Analysis: Reviewed Judy Brakebill Jones 2008 Revocable Trust—successor trustee appointment language clear and unambiguous (Eric appointed as sole successor trustee, sole beneficiary)
* PC 850 Petition Requirements: Researched California Probate Code § 850 and LA County Probate local rules (petition format, notice requirements, hearing procedures)
* Shellpoint SII Analysis: Analyzed November 3, 2025 call transcript with Sonia C. (Shellpoint rep) to identify denial rationale and regulatory leverage
* Foreclosure Timeline Risk: Identified 6 months delinquent status but no active foreclosure (no sale date set, reinstatement still available)


Evidence Secured:


* Trust Document: Judy Brakebill Jones 2008 Revocable Trust appointing Eric as sole successor trustee and sole beneficiary (no ambiguity)
* Shellpoint Loan Account Status:
   * Account Number: 0695281006
   * 6 months delinquent
   * Amount due: $5,610.36
   * Reinstatement quote: $6,540.42 (valid through December 3, 2025)
* CFPB Complaint Confirmation:
   * ID: 251104-25540274
   * Filed: November 3, 2025
   * Issue: Trouble during payment process (SII application obstruction)
* LA County Probate Rules: CRC 2.111 first-page formatting requirements (technical compliance checklist)


Strategic Value:
Complete property status visibility—no hidden liens, no title defects, no competing claims with legal standing. Gary Jones has no defensible position. Shellpoint obstruction is procedural (not substantive denial).


________________


Bird #2: Evidence (Filing Package Preparation)
Actions Taken:


October 30, 2025 — Initial Filing Package Prepared:


1. PC 850 Petition — Property recovery from Gary Jones (alleges non-beneficiary attempting asset conversion)
2. Ex Parte TRO Application — Freeze Gary Jones asset dissipation (prevent sale or encumbrance during litigation)
3. Memorandum of Points and Authorities — Legal analysis supporting PC 850 entitlement
4. Proposed Order — Draft court order for judge signature
5. Declaration of Eric Jones — Factual basis (successor trustee appointment, Gary Jones's lack of standing)
6. Exhibits Package — Trust document, death certificate, property title report
7. Proof of Service — Notice to Gary Jones and interested parties


November 4, 2025 — E-Filing Rejection:


* All 7 documents rejected for CRC 2.111 formatting issues
* Clerk Comment: "refer to california rules of court (rule 2.111) on how to format the first page"
* Issue: First-page layout non-compliant (attorney info placement, court title line, clerk space reservation)


CRC 2.111 Requirements (Identified):


* Attorney Info: Left side, top of page (Name, State Bar #, address, phone, email, "Attorney for [party]")
* Court Title: Line 8, at least 3⅓ inches from top
* Clerk Space: Right side, top of page (2-inch box reserved for filing stamp)
* Font/Margins: 12-point, 1-inch margins (standard, Eric's documents compliant)
* Caption Format: Case name, case number, document title (standard, Eric's documents compliant)


Analysis: Eric's documents failed on layout, not substance. Content is legally sufficient (petition states valid claim, exhibits support entitlement, proposed order is appropriate). This is correctable in 1-2 hours with attorney template.


________________

Bird #3: Proactive (Mortgage Servicer Pressure)
Actions Taken:


November 3, 2025 — CFPB Complaint Filed Against Shellpoint


* Complaint ID: 251104-25540274
* Issue Category: Trouble during payment process (SII application obstruction)
* Allegations:
   1. RESPA Regulation X Violation: Servicer failed to acknowledge complete SII application within 5 days
   2. Unlawful Documentation Demand: Shellpoint demands "court order appointing trustee" despite California Probate Code § 18100.5 (trust document provides automatic authority)
   3. Circular Logic: Claims SII application "incomplete" but won't specify missing documents
* Timeline: Shellpoint must respond within 15–60 days (CFPB company response requirement)


Evidence Provided to CFPB:


* Attachment 1: Judy Brakebill Jones 2008 Revocable Trust (successor trustee appointment language)
* Attachment 2: Death certificate (triggers successor trustee authority)
* Attachment 3: November 3, 2025 call transcript with Sonia C. (Shellpoint rep denial rationale)
* Attachment 4: SII application submission documentation (proves application was complete)


Regulatory Leverage:


* CFPB Complaint Triggers Internal Escalation: Servicers route CFPB complaints to compliance department (not frontline customer service)
* RESPA Violations: Regulation X violations carry mandatory penalties (servicer liability regardless of intent)
* SII Application Re-Review: CFPB pressure forces servicer to re-evaluate denial (compliance department overrides frontline denial)


________________




Reinstatement Strategy (Post-SII Approval):


Step 1: SII Application Approval (Projected Timeline)


* CFPB complaint filed November 3, 2025
* Servicer internal review: 15-30 days
* SII approval projected: December 2025
* Trigger: PC 850 court order appointing Eric as successor trustee = proof of authority Shellpoint claims to require


Step 2: Reinstatement (Projected Timeline)


* Reinstatement quote: $6,540.42 (valid through December 3, 2025)
* Payment source: Eric's personal funds (reimbursable from trust estate)
* Projected reinstatement: December 2025 – January 2026
* Result: Mortgage current, foreclosure risk eliminated


Step 3: Loss Mitigation Options (Post-Reinstatement)


* Forbearance: Suspend payments 3-6 months while trust administration finalizes
* Loan Modification: Reduce monthly payment to affordable level (successor trustee as new borrower)
* Assumption: Eric assumes loan in his individual capacity (successor trustee authority allows this)


Strategic Value:
CFPB complaint + court order = dual-pressure forcing servicer compliance. Servicers can't ignore federal regulator + court order combination. This is regulatory asymmetry—$0 CFPB complaint triggers $50K+ internal compliance review (servicer loses money fighting Eric's legitimate claim).


________________


Bird #4: Counter-Intel (Gary Jones Obstruction)
Actions Taken:


* Monitored Gary Jones Asset Dissipation Risk: Ex parte TRO prepared as countermeasure if Gary attempts to sell/encumber property
* Anticipated Probate Opposition Tactics:
   * Likely to claim trust invalidity (undue influence, lack of capacity)
   * Likely to contest successor trustee appointment (claim family conflict)
   * Likely to demand formal probate (vs. trust administration) to create delay
* Prepared Evidence Package:
   * Trust execution circumstances (2008, 17 years before Judy's death, no undue influence)
   * Judy's capacity evidence (no dementia, no cognitive impairment)
   * Eric's fiduciary duty history (sole caregiver during final years, no self-dealing)


Insight Gained:
Gary Jones has no legal standing (non-beneficiary, not named in trust, not alternative trustee), but may attempt procedural warfare—file opposition briefs, demand continuances, claim discovery needed. This is delay tactic, not substantive defense.


Counter-Strategy:


* Ex Parte TRO (If Asset Dissipation Occurs): If Gary attempts to sell property, Eric files emergency TRO to freeze transaction (court grants within 24-48 hours)
* Summary Judgment Motion (After PC 850 Granted): Once court confirms Eric's successor trustee authority, any Gary Jones opposition is frivolous (sanctions motion if he persists)
* Costs Award: California Probate Code § 17211 allows recovery of attorney fees from Gary Jones if he litigates without substantial justification


Strategic Value:
Ex parte TRO (if granted) freezes assets during litigation, preventing Gary Jones from liquidating trust property. Even if TRO not needed (Gary doesn't act), preparation creates deterrence—Gary knows Eric will respond immediately to any dissipation attempt.

Coalition vs. Traditional Attorney:


Traditional Attorney Approach:


* Retainer: $15K-$30K upfront
* Timeline: 6-12 months (probate + mortgage negotiation)
* Control: Attorney makes strategic decisions, client has limited input
* Cost-Benefit: Attorney fees = 14-28% of property equity


Eric's Coalition Approach:


* Cost: $75-$500 (One Legal + potential H Bui consult)
* Timeline: 2-4 months (PC 850 petition + SII approval)
* Control: Eric retains strategic control, coalition provides targeted support
* Cost-Benefit: Coalition cost = 0.02-0.125% of property equity


Force Multiplier: 30–400x ROI


* Conservative: $75 One Legal cost → $1.1M property preserved = 14,667x (unrealistic to attribute full property value to e-filing service)
* Realistic: $75-$500 coalition cost vs. $15K-$30K attorney retainer = 30-400x savings
* Practical: $75-$500 coalition cost achieves same outcome (property preserved, mortgage reinstated) as $15K-$30K traditional attorney

4. Coalition Filing Strategy (When to Engage Attorney vs. Professional Service)


Decision Tree:


OPTION A: Attorney Friend/Contact (Relationship-Based Coalition)


Use When:


* ✅ Personal relationship exists (guest post collaboration, funeral attendance, professional network)
* ✅ Technical issue only (formatting, procedure) vs. substantive legal question
* ✅ Attorney's practice area matches (probate attorney for probate filing)
* ✅ You're comfortable asking for favor (relationship strong enough)


How to Approach:


"[Attorney Name], I'm handling my mom's trust administration pro per and hit a CRC 2.111 formatting issue. 
LA County rejected my PC 850 petition for first-page layout (not substance). 


Would you be willing to review my documents and add your letterhead? I've done the legal research 
and drafted everything—just need formatting compliance and attorney credibility boost.


I understand if your time doesn't permit, and I'm happy to pay if you prefer. Just thought I'd ask 
given our [relationship context: guest post collaboration, mom's funeral, etc.].


Either way, appreciate you!"

Strategic Value:


* Zero cost (if relationship-based favor)
* Attorney credibility (court more receptive to attorney-signed documents)
* Maintains pro per control (you did the work, attorney just corrects format)


________________




OPTION B: Professional Service (One Legal, LegalZoom, Rocket Lawyer)


Use When:


* ✅ No attorney relationship available
* ✅ 48-hour deadline or time pressure
* ✅ Rejection protection needed (guarantees or refunds if rejected again)
* ✅ Cost-benefit favorable ($75-$150 vs. $15K-$30K full attorney retention)

One Legal Advantages (California-Specific):


* CRC 2.111 expertise (California Rules of Court specialists)
* LA County Probate experience (knows local court preferences)
* Concierge service (dedicated support for pro per filers)


________________




OPTION C: Full Attorney Retention (Last Resort)


Use When:


* ❌ Substantive legal issue arises (opposing party files credible motion)
* ❌ Case complexity increases beyond pro per capability
* ❌ Court indicates attorney representation required (rare but possible)
* ❌ Coalition strategies fail (technical rejection persists, CFPB complaint doesn't work)


When NOT to Retain Attorney:


* Don't panic at first filing rejection (80% are technical/formatting, not substantive)
* Don't assume attorney needed for "complex" probate (most trust administration is straightforward)
* Don't let opposing party intimidate with attorney letterhead (their attorney may be equally ineffective)


Cost-Benefit Decision Point:


* If attorney fees > 10% of property equity → explore coalition strategies first
* If attorney fees < 5% of property equity → consider retention (risk-adjusted value)

SECTION 6: STRATEGIC INSIGHTS
Why This Approach Works
1. Trim Tab Principle
Anuar's attorney letterhead (free, 2-hour favor) > $15K probate attorney retainer for formatting correction.


Mechanism: LA County Probate Court processes thousands of filings monthly. Attorney-signed documents receive credibility presumption—clerk assumes attorney knows formatting rules, less likely to reject on technicalities. This isn't favoritism; it's efficiency heuristic (court staff use attorney signature as quality signal).


Eric's Application: First filing (pro per, no attorney letterhead) → rejected on CRC 2.111 technicality. Second filing (Anuar's letterhead) → likely acceptance because attorney signature signals compliance. Same substantive content, different credibility signal.


________________




2. CFPB as Force Multiplier
$0 complaint filing triggers $50K+ servicer compliance review (regulatory asymmetry).


Why Servicers Settle:


* CFPB Investigation Cost: Compliance department staff time ($200/hour × 100+ hours = $20K+)
* Reputational Risk: CFPB enforcement actions are public record (damages company reputation)
* Pattern Investigation: CFPB may review all SII applications (systemic risk if other complaints exist)
* Regulatory Fine Risk: RESPA violations carry per-violation penalties ($5,000-$25,000 per violation)


Eric's Leverage:


* Shellpoint's SII denial is indefensible (California Probate Code § 18100.5 provides authority, servicer's "court order" demand contradicts state law)
* CFPB complaint + PC 850 court order = dual-pressure Shellpoint can't ignore
* Servicer's rational decision: approve SII application (zero cost) vs. fight CFPB investigation ($50K+ cost)


________________




3. Coalition > Transactional Services
Personal relationship with Anuar (June guest post, mom's funeral connection) provides zero-cost professional support.


Relationship History:


* June 2025: Eric published guest post on Anuar's blog (7-hour research project, goodwill deposit)
* August 2025: Anuar attended Judy's funeral (personal connection deepened)
* November 2025: Eric requests CRC 2.111 formatting help (goodwill withdrawal, relationship-based favor)


Why This Works:


* Reciprocity: Eric provided value first (guest post, 7-hour research), Anuar reciprocates (2-hour formatting help)
* Personal Connection: Funeral attendance = genuine relationship (not transactional business contact)
* Professional Alignment: Anuar practices probate law (perfect skill match for Eric's need)


Coalition vs. Transactional:


* Transactional: "I need attorney for PC 850 petition" → $15K-$30K retainer quote → cost-prohibitive
* Coalition: "Anuar, can you help with formatting?" → zero cost → relationship-based favor


________________




4. Technical Rejection ≠ Substantive Weakness
CRC 2.111 formatting is easily correctable; substance of petition is strong (clear trust language, valid successor trustee appointment).


Eric's Petition Substance (Strong):


* Trust document unambiguous (Eric appointed as sole successor trustee, sole beneficiary)
* Gary Jones has zero standing (not named in trust, not beneficiary, not alternative trustee)
* California Probate Code § 850 supports petition (court may order property transfer to successor trustee)
* Evidence is complete (trust document, death certificate, title report)


Formatting Issue (Weak/Correctable):


* CRC 2.111 first-page layout (attorney info placement, clerk space, court title line)
* This is mechanical compliance, not legal analysis
* Correctable in 1-2 hours with attorney template


Lesson: Don't panic at filing rejections. 80% are technical (formatting, caption errors, missing signature), not substantive legal deficiencies. Fix technical issue and refile—substance remains unchanged.


________________




5. Dual-Track Strategy (Probate + Regulatory)
PC 850 court order + CFPB pressure = overwhelming Shellpoint compliance incentive.


Track #1: Probate Court (PC 850 Petition)


* Goal: Court order appointing Eric as successor trustee
* Timeline: November 8 refiling → December hearing → January 2026 order
* Strategic Value: Legal authority confirmation vis-à-vis Gary Jones and Shellpoint


Track #2: CFPB Complaint (Shellpoint Obstruction)


* Goal: Force Shellpoint to process SII application
* Timeline: November 3 complaint → 15-30 day servicer review → December 2025 approval projected
* Strategic Value: Regulatory pressure (servicer can't ignore federal regulator)


Dual-Track Synergy:


* Timeline: Both tracks converge December 2025 (court order + CFPB pressure simultaneous)
* Leverage: Shellpoint faces court order (legal authority proven) + CFPB investigation (regulatory risk) = overwhelming incentive to approve SII
* Cost: $75-$500 (coalition approach) vs. $15K-$30K (traditional attorney approach)

Key Lessons for Trust Administrators
Lesson 1: Don't Panic at Filing Rejections
80% of e-filing rejections are technical (formatting, caption errors, missing signatures), not substantive legal deficiencies.


What to Do:


1. Read clerk's rejection comment carefully (identifies specific issue)
2. Research identified rule (CRC 2.111 in Eric's case)
3. Correct technical issue (use court template or attorney help)
4. Refile within 2-3 days (don't delay—momentum matters)


What NOT to Do:


* Don't assume rejection means petition is legally deficient
* Don't hire $15K-$30K attorney for formatting correction
* Don't give up (technical issues are easily correctable)


________________




Lesson 2: Leverage Attorney Coalitions for Credibility Without Full Retention
Personal relationships with attorneys provide zero-cost professional support for technical issues.


How to Build Attorney Coalitions:


1. Provide value first: Guest posts, referrals, professional collaboration
2. Attend personal events: Funerals, weddings, professional conferences (deepen relationships)
3. Ask appropriately: Technical help (formatting, procedure) vs. substantive representation
4. Reciprocate: Offer value in return (testimonials, referrals, future collaboration)


Eric's Coalition:


* Anuar Ramirez (June guest post + Judy's funeral) → CRC 2.111 formatting help ($0)
* H Bui Law Firm (SVS case) → professional network activated ($7,500 retainer, but Eric provided $50K intelligence work product)


________________




Lesson 3: CFPB Complaints Are the Most Underutilized Pro Per Weapon Against Mortgage Servicers
15-day company response requirement forces internal escalation that attorney demand letters don't achieve.


Why CFPB Works:


* Federal Jurisdiction: Servicer can't ignore federal regulator (vs. state complaint or attorney letter)
* Mandatory Response: 15-day timeline to respond to CFPB (vs. attorney letter servicer can ignore indefinitely)
* Compliance Department Routing: CFPB complaints bypass frontline customer service → route directly to compliance department (decision-makers)
* Pattern Investigation Risk: CFPB may review servicer's SII application practices system-wide (class action catalyst)


Eric's Application:


* Shellpoint SII denial (October 2025): frontline reps claim "policy" requires court order
* CFPB complaint filed (November 3, 2025): compliance department forced to review
* Projected outcome (December 2025): SII approval after compliance department overrides frontline denial


Replication: Any successor trustee facing servicer SII obstruction should file CFPB complaint immediately (don't wait for attorney or court order).

ROI Calculation Verification
Force Multiplier: 30–400x ROI


Calculation Method #1 (Coalition Cost vs. Traditional Attorney Retainer):


* Coalition Cost: $75-$500 (One Legal Concierge + potential H Bui consult)
* Traditional Attorney Retainer: $15,000-$30,000
* Savings: $14,500-$29,500
* ROI: $15,000 / $500 = 30x (conservative) | $30,000 / $75 = 400x (optimistic)


Calculation Method #2 (Cost vs. Property Equity Preserved):


* Coalition Cost: $75-$500
* Property Equity: $400K (after paying $704K mortgage)
* ROI: $400,000 / $500 = 800x (but unrealistic to attribute full equity to e-filing service)


Practical Interpretation:
Eric's coalition approach ($75-$500) achieves same outcome (property preserved, mortgage reinstated, Gary Jones obstruction defeated) as traditional attorney approach ($15K-$30K retainer) = 30-400x cost advantage.
