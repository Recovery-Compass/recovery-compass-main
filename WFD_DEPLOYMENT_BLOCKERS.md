# WFD Compliance Dashboard - Deployment Blockers

## Current Situation

### ‚úÖ What We Built (Code Complete)
All WFD Compliance Dashboard code has been created in the recovery-compass-main repository:

**Created Files:**
- `/src/types/compliance.ts` - Type definitions
- `/src/lib/complianceCalculations.ts` - Business logic
- `/src/stores/complianceStore.ts` - Zustand state management
- `/src/components/compliance/` - 5 React components
  - FileUploadInterface.tsx
  - OverviewMetrics.tsx  
  - ClientDataTable.tsx
  - DataQualityDashboard.tsx
  - ProgramPerformanceTable.tsx
- `/src/components/wfd-suite/WFDComplianceLayout.tsx` - Layout wrapper
- `/src/pages/wfd/` - 4 dashboard pages
  - ComplianceDashboard.tsx
  - ClientList.tsx
  - ProgramPerformance.tsx
  - DataQuality.tsx
- Updated `/src/App.tsx` with WFD routes
- Updated `tailwind.config.ts` with WFD colors
- Added dependencies: react-dropzone, jspdf, jspdf-autotable, xlsx, zustand

### ‚ùå What's Blocking Deployment

**Critical Issue:** Vite build system not working
- `vite` package won't install despite being in package.json
- `npm install vite` succeeds but vite doesn't appear in node_modules
- `npx vite` tries to download but hangs
- Cannot build the project to generate dist/ folder with WFD code

**Root Cause:** Unknown Node.js/npm environment issue
- Node v22.20.0 installed (correct version)
- npm packages install normally  
- Only vite specifically fails to install/run

### üìä Current dist/ Folder Status
- Contains OLD Recovery Compass build from Oct 20
- Does NOT contain WFD Compliance Dashboard
- Size: 86MB (Recovery Compass assets)
- WFD code has never been compiled

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Lovable.dev (RECOMMENDED - Fastest)

**Why:** Lovable handles the build environment and deployment automatically.

**Steps:**
1. Create new "WFD Compliance Dashboard" project in Lovable
2. Paste the comprehensive WFD build prompt (from this session)
3. Lovable builds and tests automatically
4. Deploy directly from Lovable
5. Connect to compliance.erdmethod.org subdomain

**Time:** 15-30 minutes total

**Pros:**
- No local build issues
- Lovable handles all dependencies
- Clean, tested deployment
- Can iterate quickly if changes needed

**Cons:**
- Need to rebuild in Lovable (but code already designed)
- Separate repository from recovery-compass-main

### Option 2: Fix Local Build Environment

**Steps to Try:**
1. Use `nvm` to switch Node versions (try v20.x or v18.x)
2. Clear all npm caches: `npm cache clean --force`
3. Delete node_modules completely
4. Try `pnpm` or `yarn` instead of npm
5. Check for conflicting global packages
6. Try building in a Docker container

**Time:** 1-3 hours of troubleshooting

**Pros:**
- Everything in one repository
- Local development possible

**Cons:**
- Time-consuming to debug
- May not resolve the vite issue
- Could have other build problems

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Steps:**
1. Build WFD Dashboard in Lovable (working environment)
2. Download the built code from Lovable
3. Sync to local recovery-compass-main
4. Deploy from local using existing dist/

**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**Pros:**
- Get working dashboard quickly
- Have code locally for reference
- Can deploy from existing infrastructure

## Immediate Action Plan

**Recommended: Use Lovable.dev**

1. **In Lovable.dev browser tab:**
   - Create new project: "WFD Compliance Dashboard"
   - Use the build prompt from earlier in this session

2. **Lovable Will Generate:**
   - All components, pages, types
   - Working file upload interface
   - Data processing and validation
   - Metrics calculations
   - Export functionality

3. **Test in Lovable:**
   - Upload sample Housing Tracker Excel file
   - Verify calculations
   - Test all features

4. **Deploy:**
   - Lovable deploys to Cloudflare/Netlify/Vercel
   - Connect custom domain: compliance.erdmethod.org
   - Site live in < 30 minutes

## WFD Dashboard Requirements Recap

### Must Have Features (All Designed)
‚úÖ Drag-and-drop Excel/CSV upload
‚úÖ Real-time data processing (no backend needed)
‚úÖ Overview metrics dashboard
‚úÖ Client data table (sortable, filterable, exportable)
‚úÖ Program performance comparison
‚úÖ MOU compliance validation (80% threshold)
‚úÖ Data quality scoring
‚úÖ Export to Excel

### Technical Stack
‚úÖ React + TypeScript
‚úÖ Zustand for state management
‚úÖ xlsx library for Excel parsing
‚úÖ react-dropzone for file upload
‚úÖ Tailwind CSS with WFD brand colors
‚úÖ date-fns for date calculations

### Sample Data Format
Excel/CSV with columns:
- ClientID
- ProgramName
- IntakeDate
- ExitDate
- ExitDestination
- HousingPlacementDate
- LengthOfStay

## Next Steps Decision

**Choose one:**

**A. Build in Lovable** (Recommended)
   ‚Üí Create Lovable project now
   ‚Üí Deploy in 30 minutes

**B. Fix Local Build**
   ‚Üí Troubleshoot vite installation
   ‚Üí May take hours, uncertain outcome

**C. Use Existing erdmethod.org**
   ‚Üí Add WFD dashboard as `/wfd/compliance` routes
   ‚Üí Still need to build the code (same vite issue)

---

**My Recommendation:** Use Lovable.dev to build and deploy the WFD Compliance Dashboard. The code design is complete and solid. Lovable will generate it working without build environment issues, and you'll have it deployed to compliance.erdmethod.org within 30 minutes.

The local code we wrote can serve as a reference or backup, but Lovable is the fastest path to a working deployment.
